# This is an exploration of ARIA


The main purpose of this code was to experiment with implementing WAI-ARIA.  It is built on top of Sails and pulls various code from a range of sources.  The main framework was taken from:

## activityOverlord v2.0

A series of screencasts made to learn Angular and how to integrate it with the new features of Sails.js v0.11.0.
